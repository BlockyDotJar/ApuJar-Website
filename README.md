This website serves as documentation for my Twitch bot ApuJar. 
This website is written in markdown using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

## View documentation website locally

To view the documentation website locally, you first need to install mkdocs-material and mkdocs-redirects:

```

You can 'serve' the site locally and preview your changes you've written with this command:

```sh
